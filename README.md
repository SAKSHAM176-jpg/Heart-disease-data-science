# Heart-disease-data-science
Predicting heart disease using machine learning with Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Based on UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.

This project explores how machine learning and data science techniques can be applied to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on clinical parameters.
Using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, the notebook demonstrates the complete workflow of building, evaluating, and experimenting with classification models.



### **🚀 Project Workflow**

We’ll follow a structured approach:

Problem Definition –
Can we predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes?

Data Source –
The dataset used is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the

UCI Machine Learning Repository → https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

Kaggle version →  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset

Evaluation Metric –
Target accuracy: ≥ 95% during proof of concept.
